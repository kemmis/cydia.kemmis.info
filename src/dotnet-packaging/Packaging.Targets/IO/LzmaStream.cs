    ///  - After allocating <see cref="LzmaStream"/> (on stack or with malloc()), it must be

    ///  - Initialize a coder to the lzma_stream, for example by using
    ///    lzma_easy_encoder() or lzma_auto_decoder(). Some notes:
    ///      - In contrast to zlib, <see cref="LzmaStream.NextIn"/> and <see cref="LzmaStream.NextOut"/> are
    ///        ignored by all initialization functions, thus it is safe
    ///        to not initialize them yet.
    ///      - The initialization functions always set strm->total_in and
    ///        strm->total_out to zero.
    ///      - If the initialization function fails, no memory is left allocated
    ///        that would require freeing with <see cref="NativeMethods.lzma_end(ref LzmaStream)"/> even if some memory was
    ///        associated with the <see cref="LzmaStream"/> structure when the initialization
    ///        function was called.
